# L-RadSet: A Long-range Multimodal Dataset with 4D Radar for Autonomous Driving and Its Application
<p style=""text-align:justify; text-justify:interideograph;">
A long-range and robust perception system plays a crucial role in advancing research and deployment of autonomous driving. 4D radar, as an emerging range sensor, offers superior resilience to adverse weather conditions than lidar and provides elevation measurement compared to 3D radar. Existing 4D radar datasets, emphasizing robust and multimodal perception, typically combine camera, lidar, and 4D radar. However, they often lack long-range capability due to limited annotations. Furthermore, the configuration of their single short-focus camera fails to effectively match a long-range 4D radar. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel long-range multimodal dataset. It encompasses high-resolution and long-range sensors, including forward-facing cameras, a 360° lidar, and a front-mounted 4D radar, along with detailed annotations for 3D objects. Particularly, our dataset introduces, for the first time, three cameras with different focal lengths, enabling simultaneous capture of images with varying perception ranges. It serves as a valuable resource for developing accurate long-range perception algorithms. Remarkably, our dataset achieves the longest annotation ranges among comparable 4D radar datasets, spanning up to 220 meters. It supports applications such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as facilitates the study of multimodal tasks. Through rigorous experiments, we validate the efficacy of our dataset and offer valuable insights into long-range 3D object detection.

<strong>[2024.07.18]  Our work has been accepted as a regular paper by IEEE TIV. [article](#https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591452). </strong>
<strong>[2024.04.17]  We have released the dataset download [link](#downloadlink). </strong> 

[2024.04.17] Our Code currently supports some baselines including DETR3D, Pointpillars, Second, and PV-RCNN. 

# 1. Introduction
<p style=""text-align:justify; text-justify:interideograph;">
L-RadSet includes over 133K high-quality, manually annotated 3D ground bounding boxes, covering nine categories of static and dynamic objects within a long range of up to 220 meters. Each ground truth box is accompanied by a track identifier to facilitate 3D object tracking. Furthermore, our dataset comprises 280 meticulously selected driving scenes, each spanning 20 seconds. These scenes consist of a total of 11.2K keyframes, capturing data from diverse real-world traffic scenarios. For training and validation purposes, we partitioned these scenes into 225 samples, reserving 55 scenes for testing.

### Sensor Configuration 

Our ego vehicle is equipped with three front-view cameras featuring varying focal lengths and field-of-view (FOV) characteristics, as depicted in Figure 2. This configuration enhances the ability to perceive distant objects captured by the images within a wide horizontal field of view. Furthermore, our top lidar captures data within a 360° horizontal field of view, reaching a range of up to 230 meters. This high-resolution and long-range capability enables precise and distant annotations in our dataset. Additionally, our 4D radar covers a forward range of 120° and can detect objects up to 300 meters away. These sensors play a crucial role in facilitating the development of effective long-range and robust perception algorithms within our dataset. Moreover, our autonomous driving platform incorporates GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) systems to provide and collect accurate location information.

# 2. Data Acquisition and Distribution

* We analyze the distribution of frames across different weather conditions, times of day, and road types. As visually depicted in Fig. 4(b) and (c), our data collection process involved capturing various weather conditions, such as clear, cloudy, rainy, and foggy scene, as well as different light conditions, ranging from daytime to dusk and nighttime situations. Notably, our dataset includes a significant proportion of nighttime scenes, thereby encompassing more challenging scenarios to develop more robust detection algorithms. Additionally, to cover a comprehensive array of driving scenarios, we meticulously collected data from urban roads, highways, suburban roads, and tunnel scenarios, as presented in Fig. 3(d). This data collection strategy ensures the inclusion of a diverse set of real-world traffic scenes, facilitating the creation of a more comprehensive dataset.

Our dataset collects data from two different cities, which encompasses four weather conditions, three light conditions from day to night, and four road types. </b></font></p>

# 3. Data visulization

* We present various driving scenes in Fig. 5. These scenes encompass typical driving environments such as urban, suburban, and highway, as well as some challenging scenarios like nighttime, adverse weather, and low-light tunnel. As can be seen in Figure 7(d), (e), and (h), the camera is highly affected by light, and the captured images even lack RGB information to observe the object when the light is extremely weak. Therefore, in this scenario, lidar can acquire very tight spatial information, compensating for the camera’s shortcomings. In addition, adverse weather such as fog and rain can also affect image quality to some extent, but the performance degradation is much lower than the effect of low light, as shown in Figure 6(b) and (c). Adverse weather tends to cause the lidar to produce more noise, which affects its detection. In this case, the semantic information of the image and the accurate 3D measurements provided by the 4D radar point cloud can be used to enhance the detection performance.
